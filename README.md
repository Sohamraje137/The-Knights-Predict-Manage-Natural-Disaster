# Predict-Manage-Natural-Disaster
  To find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict,manage the impact of natural disasters.


## Introduction

  We cannot stop natural disasters but we can arm ourselves with knowledge: so many lives wouldn't have to be lost if there was enough disaster preparedness. Today's technology helps us in predicting a lot of calamaties like Tsunami,Volcanic eruption, cyclones etc. The World of computer science has been evolved itself in increasing its efficiency and accuracy to predict using Machine learning or Deep Learning etc.

## Our Plan

  We aim at using these tools to design a algorithm which will help in managing the water related calamities.The recent floods in Kerala caused a immenses loss to life and economy.

  After predicting a calamity it's very important to send this informations to the local public and this is the most important task. Once our Model predicts that there is an emergency we will send messages through whatsapp, SMS etc., to the subscribers of our website. As there may be people who are not aware of our website. We will be sending tweets to the Media houses,Radio Stations, Politicians, Celebrites of various feild like sports,film industries, businessman etc. This information will also be tweeted to NGO's , Emergency Helpline services and other related organisation. This will help in spreading the word easily. The message will be sent to the Scientific departments of the country to varify too. The first message will be an alert message and only after recieving an reply from Government departments and the emergency message will be sent.This will make this system more reliable and recognised.We will b using twilio API of python to send text messages through the website. twitteroauth API of tweeter will be used to send tweets.

   While we build a model to predict the calamity we will calculate the losses the calamity can bring. This model will be developed based on the analysis of tweets, the governement statistics, after a calamity . We will be using tweeters API for this. This will help in estimsting the losses and also the intensity of emergency level in future situations.

These are our plan for the competition. 

## Resources and Datasets

  We are planning to use the data provided by the governement and other private organizations about the past events. Some of them are listed below along with some useful resources that may help our project.
  * [Open Data-1](https://data.gov.in/resources/state-wise-details-damage-due-cyclonic-storm-flash-floods-floods-landslides-cloudburst-etc)
  *  [Open Data-2](https://data.gov.in/resources/state-wise-details-cropped-areas-affected-due-cycloneflash-floodfloodslandslidescloudburst)

## Technologies we are using

* We will be building the entire website in django and hosting it on azure.
* Microsoft Azure as cloud computing service
